# what i learned with this project?
## general concept: "Validation"
there are some layers to this:
    1. Request Validation: 
        => happens via FluentValidation for this project, here we check the incoming input values, it's like a structure check
    2. Business Logic Validation: 
        => happens via the service/business layer methods, input values are checked against more complex (compared to request validation) business rules
    3. Database Constraints: 
        => database constraints are configured within the schema and are enforced automatically by the database engine

think of it like this:
    1. this is for DTOs / code is stored in the business layer
    2. this is for service methods / code is stored in the business layer
    3. this is for the models / code is stored in the data layer

## specific: FluentValidation
